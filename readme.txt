"make" or "make stats" to compile the stats executable
"make clean" to remove stats executable and object files (please make clean before commiting/pushing)

due to the layout of the headers and src files you may need to configure your editor to recognize the #includes if you don't want to be seeing in-editor error messages, even though the makefile is configured to do so automatically. If you use YCM with vim and don't know how to do this i can help

layout is not finalized but i was doing some research and this seems like a good starting folder structure for a decent sized project
